The Solid Core Team, Solid DX Team as well as our generous corporate sponsors
[Netlify](https://www.netlify.com) and [Sentry](https://sentry.io/) are proud to
announce SolidHack 2024. This years prize totals US$15,000 and is graciously contributed
evenly by both sponsors.

The inaugural SolidHack event was so successful that we decided to bring it back this
year. A lot has changed since the previous event though. Solid and the ecosystem have matured
considerably and SolidStart is now 1.0. It's an ideal time to be working with Solid!
We're giving the talented developers in our community an incredible opportunity to
show what they got and win prize money.

Additional contest details regarding the event including rules and categories will be announced
on October 1st. Visit the [SolidHack website](https://hack.solidjs.com/) to learn more!
