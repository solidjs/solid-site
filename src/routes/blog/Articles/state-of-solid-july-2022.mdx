The second quarter of 2022 has proven to be very eventful for Solid. Since the last article, we’ve seen an incredible amount of growth and progress. We’ve structured new core efforts, and an incredible amount of organic growth has attracted new users and followers of the project. Here’s a recap of what we’ve been up to over the past quarter.

# Sponsorships

We’re proud to announce that the amazing folks at JetBrains have decided to sponsor SolidJS for $500/month. They’re known for intelligent development tools and IDEs like WebStorm and IntelliJ, and their open-source support includes projects like Nest and XState.

The Solid Core team feels privileged by this amazing recognition. We’re very lucky to have monthly like `Netlify` ($500), `Vercel` ($100), `Builder` ($100), `<div>riots` ($100).

Funds contributed to SolidJS go towards covering domain registrations, events and meetups, and other initiatives that benefit the community at large.

# Awards & Recognition

SolidJS is the recipient of the OSAwards 2022 Breakthrough of the Year Award!

  </a>
</center>

Solid never sought to win awards, and they aren’t common in the open-source world. This kind of recognition is cause for celebration and reflection. Vite (2021), Deno & Svelte (2020) and Strapi (2019) all received this award, and it validates Solid’s path as a project and a community.

We were delighted to see this, and we hope to deliver more breakthroughs for years to come!

# Community, Growth and Ecosystem

Solid’s growth in the second quarter was greater than we anticipated. As we’ve mentioned in our previous reports, our week over week increase has shown no signs of stopping. Our key indicators across Twitter, Github, and Discord are all extremely positive.

The following are charts taken directly from our recent Community Meeting:

![Community Stats](/img/blog/state-of-solid-july-2022/community-stats.png)

Our base metrics show growth across our websites and social media: more people are hearing about, talking about, and trying Solid.

An important metric used specifically within open-source is Github Stars, which allow users to flag open-source projects on GitHub. Solid has surpassed a major 20k star milestone:

![Github Stars](/img/blog/state-of-solid-july-2022/github-star-chart.png)

Above all else, the metric we’re eager to track is NPM downloads, which is our best representation of Solid’s usage. In this quarter alone we saw a download increase up to 31%. We anticipate this number to continue its increase as Solid adoption picks up.

![NPM downloads](/img/blog/state-of-solid-july-2022/npm-downloads.png)

In summary, growth this quarter has been pretty fantastic!

# Solid Meetups

This quarter our Core team has stepped up on efforts to engage directly with community members by running in-person events. We hosted two meetups, in New York City and San Francisco.

![June and July Meetups](/img/blog/state-of-solid-july-2022/june-july-meetup.png)

With meetups, we can foster a community that goes beyond online connections. It’s an opportunity to meet other Soliders, share advice and experiences, and talk about where we’re heading as a project and a community.

If you’re interested in hosting an event in your city, please reach out to us at <a href="mailto:community@solidjs.com">community@solidjs.com</a> or hop on Discord in the #irl-meetup channel. Sponsors are encouraged to help cover the cost of event spaces or receive funding from our OpenCollective budget directly.

# Ecosystem Growth

On a weekly basis Solid grows with a number of new packages. Here’s a shortlist of projects to keep an eye on:

- [solid-devtools](https://github.com/thetarnav/solid-devtools): An incredibly ambitious project to bring Developer Tools to Solid. It’s lead by the incredibly talented Damnian Tarnawski (thetarnav), an Ecosystem Team member.
- [@motionone/solid](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@motionone/solid): The powerful MotionOne project gets official Solid support.
- [TanStack](https://tanstack.com/): TanStack goes agnostic with Solid options for Query, Table, Virtual etc.
- [solid-supabase](https://github.com/wobsoriano/solid-supabase): Use Supabase reactively with your Solid codebase
- [solid-dexie](https://github.com/faassen/solid-dexie): Dexie is a reactive IndexedDB wrapper that pairs beautifully with Solid
- [solid-lexical](https://github.com/mosheduminer/lexical-solid): Solid bindings for the [Lexical project](https://github.com/facebook/lexical#readme)

This isn’t a complete list! We do attempt to maintain a complete list of packages [on the Solid website](https://www.solidjs.com/ecosystem). Check it out, and if you have a package, be sure to submit your work.

Solid support is growing in many ways beyond its direct package support. Projects such as Astro, Tauri and Bun now offer growing levels of integration:

# Core and Team Changes

The Solid team is growing!

We’re proud to announce that Nikhil Saraf has joined as SolidStart team leader. Nikhil is a self-proclaimed “devtools maniac” and constantly strives to improve the developer experience for his teams whenever possible.

<center>![Nikhil Saraf](/img/blog/state-of-solid-july-2022/team-nikhil.png)</center>

We're excited to have him onboard!

Aside from new team membership, Solid is focusing on decentralizing core responsibilities and onboarding community team members wherever possible. Our docs team has grown and we’ve established two new teams including Infrastructure and Growth.

# Ryan joins Netlify

This quarter Ryan Carniato announced major update of his own: he has taken a new position at Netlify. This means that he will unfortunately be leaving eBay and a team of incredibly talented engineers, but he’s still involved with Marko. His new position as Principal Open-Source Engineer gives him the ability to focus on open-source projects including Solid and Marko.

Netlify is already an incredible supporter of the Solid project. With Ryan on staff, it shows how they’ve doubled-down on its mission to building powerful infrastructure and supporting the broader open-source community.

![Growth Team](/img/blog/state-of-solid-july-2022/ryan-netlify.jpeg)

You can read all about it in his article: [When Netlify asks you to full-time OSS, you say yes!](https://dev.to/ryansolid/when-netlify-asks-you-to-full-time-oss-you-say-yes-5ccf).

With this new work opportunity Ryan is officially taking the opportunity to grow his outreach efforts. His late-night stream time is now to be scheduled Friday afternoons EST to ensure a more international crowd has access to the streams. Join our Discord, follow him on Twitter or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/RyanCarniato9/videos" target="blank">visit his YouTube channel</a> for stream announcements.

# Solid Store

That’s right, it’s finally here! Our long-requested [Solid Store](https://www.solidjs.com) has launched. Profit goes straight to our OpenCollective, and we’ve strived to price the items reasonably to keep them accessible.

Solid Store was developed by Infrastructure and Core Team members using Shopify Buy API. Purchases are automatically fulfilled and shipped to customers within 1-2 weeks.

<Tweet tweetLink="davedbase/status/1545791421520777217" />

You can purchase everything from t-shirts, mouse pads, stickers, water bottles, hoodies, winter hats, ballcaps and more. We're proud of the quality and service offered by our fulfillment partners and thank them for their service and support of our community.

Head on over to grab your merch!

# Solid Playground

Our official Playground is getting an official upgrade. Thanks to the efforts of the amazing Infrastructure Team, led by modderme123, the Solid Playground now has a login feature that lets you create and save REPLs. The new Playground uses Stytch’s OAuth integration leveraged via Solid’s new custom API service. We use Supabase as the back-end thanks to the amazing support of their company.

Coming up in future upgrades, the Infrastructure Team is currently investigating WebContainers via Stackblitz. This integration will allow the playground to support SolidStart in the future. We’re very excited to be working with the Stackblitz team to stabilize the API and bring it to our project.

# Docs & Website

It’s time for the next phase of Solid Docs. On the [Solid Docs Next repo](https://github.com/solidjs/solid-docs-next), you’ll find:

- A SolidStart docs site supporting MDX
- A “four-sided” content structure, following [Diataxis](https://diataxis.fr/)
- A full [Writing Guide](https://github.com/solidjs/solid-docs-next/blob/main/WRITING.md) laying out the writing principles that drive the new docs, and a [Contributing Guide](https://github.com/solidjs/solid-docs-next/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) explaining how to be a part of it
- A [project board](https://github.com/solidjs/solid-docs-next/projects/1) laying out issues, making it clear what’s on the roadmap
- A draft of a [beginner tutorial](https://docs.solidjs.com/tutorials/getting-started-with-solid/welcome) that includes “framework asides”: choose the framework you’re coming from at the beginning, and we’ll inject tips that help you migrate

<Tweet tweetLink="rachelnabors/status/1528535366600232963" />

Currently, these docs live on their own beta site, but this will merge with our main site as it nears completion.

We presented our project at the [WriteTheDocs conference](https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/portland/2022/), and it was amazing to meet other docs enthusiasts and learn from technical writers and experts in the field.

<Tweet tweetLink="jutanium/status/1529252112026173442" />

It’s been especially exciting to see new contributors get involved in the docs, and we’re always looking for writers. On the roadmap for the next few months, we’ll be focusing on the content itself: now that the docs team and repository are set up, it’s time to create drafts for each page on the roadmap. If you love writing and want to be part of that effort, [please reach out](https://twitter.com/jutanium)!

# SolidStart Updates

SolidStart is an important part of Solid’s future. As a dedicated full-stack/SSR framework, it’s optimized for Solid and brings new architecture patterns to the table. It’s built on Vite to take full advantage of the growing Vite ecosystem, and it’s completely modular: each SolidStart feature is essentially Vite plugin.

SolidStart has seen incredible progress this quarter. We’re proud to announce that the team has mostly locked in the API for a 1.0 release and are approaching beta stability with the current foundations.

More announcements and information will be made in the coming weeks regarding the beta release.

# Core Roadmap & Updates

The past few months have been the start of a transition in direction for Solid. Version 1.3 signaled the end of the target feature set that we had envisioned for years.

Ryan will be hitting the conference circuit in the next few months. Aside from his Friday streams you can catch him at:

- [React In Real Life](https://www.meetup.com/real-world-react/events/287308278/) - July 28th
- [Houston React Developers](https://www.meetup.com/houston-react-js-group/events/286450583/) - Aug 4th
- [State of Web Components](https://www.thisdotmedia.com/state-of-the-web/state-of-web-components/) - Aug 9th
- [React Finland 2022](https://react-finland.fi/) - Sept 15th-16th
- [ViteConf](https://viteconf.org/) - Oct 10th-11th

# Conclusion

This quarter has been fantastic for community and ecosystem growth. Every day, we see new faces and new projects. As we lean into the launch of SolidStart and begin work on Solid 2.0, we invite anyone interested in contributing to make Solid a better framework for everyone. Hop on our Discord or have a look at our contributions document to learn how you can become involved.

The Solid Team is more encouraged and incentivized than ever to nurture powerful foundations. Our goal is to provide the JS ecosystem with a new alternative, one that promotes our philosophy of simplicity, performance, and reliability. Solid is about building incredible developer and user experience without compromises.

We look forward to building a rock-solid future with you!
